## Overview of the Game :
Splash Ground is a fast-paced 3D arena survival / territory-control shooter in which the player must keep the arena floor in a healthy (green) state by spraying it, while waves of monsters traverse the arena and leave behind contaminating trails (red). The player must keep at least 80% of the floor “healthy” until the timer ends. Failure occurs if pollution spreads past the threshold and the entire world is polluted beyond repair.
